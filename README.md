# F.I.S.H_V2_Game
** This is my updated version of my very first game. V2 **

* What is this?:

This is my updated version of my very first game back from 2023. I have implemented new features and used new techniques I've learned in my recent classes. This version 2 (V2) of the game does not run on a single Java file but in fact it runs on four different java files to future proof any new additions or features I'd like to add in the future.
I would still love to add more and make this an actual game you download like an exe to upload to Steam.

* Future?:

One game future update planned is that at any point during your fishing trip for endless or standard play you can stop to view your inventory by pressing i. Also in hand by making endless mode re-introduced, as I had way too many problems with it on the 1st version. Also by pressing in i i want you to see your inventory which has the fish you just caught so far or an empty bag if you just started. While in the bag you would be able to re-read the info about that fish. Another optimization in the future is removing the game text Java file as it could be placed into the game scripts so the start game Java file will have 2 to 3 less lines of code. Lastly, I want to actually make a “story” and make this all into a GUI with sounds and actual music in the background like an actual actual….. actual  game. However this is all to be determined.


Anyways I hope you also like the new verison and hopefully more will come!

Thank you.
